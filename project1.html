                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin<br> literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,<br> looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word<br> in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum<br> et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, <br>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                        The standard chunk of Lorem <br>Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact<br> original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
